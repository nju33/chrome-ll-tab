üòè Find a tab with omnibox

## Usage

The keyword `tab` is valid for this extension. Type `tab` in Omnibox and enter the` tab` key.

![active ll tab](https://github.com/nju33/chrome-ll-tab/blob/master/readme/active.png?raw=true)

## Syntax

First of all, if you enter it normally, you will search the title.

In addition, there are also two ways of writing it.

- `title:<search text>` It is the same as writing normally
- `url:<seach text>` search url

And you can search for these combinations (e.g. `title:nju33 url:google`)

The entered text is examined by regular expression, and if there are more than one, the first tab becomes active.
